![am I responsive](assets/images/readme-images/amiresponsive-apexmma.png)
Apex MMA is a website created for a local gym that teaches mixed martial arts. The target audience for the website is not limited to age however the primary target is people who are interested in MMA, as well as looking for ways to remain fit or are looking for a way to increase their fitness.

## User experience (UX)
#### Wireframes
In the wireframe stage, I used a [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) to design the initial structure of the home page. Once I had created the baseline, I decided to add content and images when it improved the visual quality and the user experience of the website.

#### Site structure
Apex MMA contains three pages which are; home, gallery and contact us. The homepage has a small about us section, a what we teach section and a timetable of when these sessions occur. The gallery page contains ten images of people participating at the club. The contact us page is divided into three sections which are; prices, FAQs and a sign-up form.
### User stories
##### First time visitors
* I want to get information on a mixed martial arts club in my local area.
* I want the site to be responsive to my device and maintain good accessibility.
* I want a website that has easy to use navigation but also informs me what page I am looking at.
* I want to be able to contact the club if I would like any information that isn't on the website.
##### Returning visitors 
* I want to be able to maintain contact with the club and remain informed about any changes to the club.
### Design choices
#### Colour scheme
I have selected three colours for the colour scheme which are white, red and black. I have selected these colours to ensure the contrast between the text, and background colours and backgrounds images makes the text readable for all users.
#### Typography
I have chosen two different fonts to use on the website which are 'montserrat' and 'bebas neue'. These fonts fit the theme of the website because they are large fonts and make the content easily readable.

## Accessibility
During the creation of the website I have kept the accessibility as friendly as possible, I have done this by:
* Using semantic HTML.
* Ensuring the colours have sufficent contrast.
* Using alt attributes on all images and links so screen readers understand their use.
* Used a clear font that is easy to read.
