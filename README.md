#### Fixed bugs
| Bug | Solution |
| ---| ---|
| favicon not loading | this was resolved by reviewing the favicon link and replacing the 'a' in assets from capital to lowercase |
| horizontal scroll on mobile phones and tablets | used a declaration to hide the overflow on the x-axis |
| header covering text main content on high resolution devices | used google chrome dev tools to adjust the resolution so i could view the change then adjusted the margin top to match the header size |
| form can be submitted without a first and last name | added an asset to the form declaration to make those fields required |

#### Unfixed bugs 
* When rotating a mobile phone horizontal the navigation doesn't fit into the header and navigation covers the text.
